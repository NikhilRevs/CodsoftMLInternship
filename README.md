🧠 Machine Learning Projects
This repository showcases the machine learning projects I completed during my internship at CodSoft. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems using classification and prediction techniques. Through these tasks, I gained hands-on experience with data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

📌 Project Highlights
Task 01: Movie Genre Classification

Task 02: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Task 03: Customer Churn Prediction

Task 04: Spam SMS Detection

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: Python

Libraries & Tools:

pandas, NumPy – Data handling and preprocessing

scikit-learn – Machine learning models, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning

matplotlib, seaborn – Data visualization
